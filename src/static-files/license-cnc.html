	It is hereby agreed as follows:
    <br/>

    <div class="well well-sm">
	<ol type="1">
		<li><p>This
		agreement is made on the date when signed by both parties and
		effective immediately.</p></li>

		<li><p>The 
		User is granted a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use,
		modify, enlarge or enrich the SCD to extract information directly
		or indirectly in any form and volume, provided that the SCD itself
		or any derivative work is used only by the User themselves or their
		immediate collaborators, employees, managers and/or their students
		from the same Institution for research purposes only, and provided
		they are continuously observing all the terms and conditions
		contained in this Agreement.</p></li>

		<li><p>The
		User shall not use the SCD itself or any derivative work (including
		but not limited to statistics obtained by using it or any
		derivative work thereof) based on it (however small the
		contribution of SCD to such derivative work is) in whatever form
		for commercial purposes of any kind.</p></li>

		<li><p>In
		all publications or publicly available materials, regardless of
		their form (printed, electronic, or other), describing work which
		uses the SCD, the User shall include a notice mentioning the fact
		that SCD are based on the respective SYN-series corpus<FONT COLOR="#000000">,</FONT>
		developed at the Institute of the Czech National Corpus and
		available from http://korpus.cz/. In the case of electronic
		publications on the Internet, the reference to the aforementioned
		web page should be included as a web link. In the case of printed
		materials, such as papers, journal articles etc., one publication
		should be included from the list given for the respective corpus on
		http://korpus.cz/.</p></li>

		<li><p>Due
		to Proprietor's obligations with regard to the text copyright
		holders, text examples and citations from SCD or any derivative
		work are limited to 100 words per example/citation and, at the same
		time, 1000 words per publication or series of publications on the
		same topic (regardless whether printed, electronic, or in any other
		form).</p></li>

		<li><p>The
		User agrees not to re-distribute or otherwise make publicly
		available the SCD, or any derivative work based on it as described
		in paragraph 3, to a third party without a prior written permission
		of the Proprietor.</p></li>

		<li><p>The
		User undertakes to adopt any security measures needed to protect
		the Proprietor's copyright in SCD and undertakes to take all
		reasonable steps to ensure that no unauthorized use is made of SCD
		and of any copies, derivative works or extracts thereof.</p></li>

		<li><p>Any
		usage of SCD which does not conform to the specification set forth
		in this Agreement is subject to separate negotiations and a written
		contract between the User and the Proprietor and/or other parties.
		The Proprietor is in general not obliged to enter and/or conclude
		such negotiations.</p></li>

		<li><p>The
		SCD is provided as is. Therefore the Proprietor does not warrant
		the usefulness of SCD for any purpose.</p></li>

		<li><p>Should
		the User by themselves or anyone acting on their behalf fail to
		comply with any of the conditions in this agreement, this agreement
		shall terminate immediately and SCD, its copies and derivative
		works based on it shall be destroyed at the User's site and at all
		sites under their control. Such termination shall be without
		prejudice to any claim which the Proprietor may have either for
		monies due and/or damages and/or otherwise.</p></li>

		<li><p>This
		agreement terminates if (a) the User destroys all copies of SCD or
		any derivative work thereof, (b) the User or their Institution
		ceases to exist, unless all their obligations are transferred to a
		new entity, which is then considered to be bound by this Agreement.
		The User or their successor shall inform the Proprietor about any
		such transfer or succession; failure to do so will terminate this
		Agreement after one month after such transfer or succession. (c)
		the Proprietor ceases to exist without a legal successor.</p></li>

		<li><p>This
		agreement is governed by the laws of the Czech Republic and all
		disputes concerning this agreement will be resolved by its
		jurisdiction.</p></li>
