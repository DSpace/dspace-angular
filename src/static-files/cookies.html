	<h3>What are cookies?</h3>
	<p>
		A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device.
		The cookie allows the website to "remember" your actions or preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over time,
		so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another. Most browsers support cookies, but users can set their browsers to decline them and can delete them whenever they like.
