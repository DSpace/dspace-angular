	    <h4><u><b>Copyright</b></u></h4>
	    <li><p>The Collection has been obtained by crawling the Internet.

	    <li><p>I understand that all the documents in the Collection are documents which have been at some time made publicly available on the

	    methods (such as robots.txt) for indicating that the documents should not be so collected.</p></li>

	    <li><p>Owners of copyright in individual documents may choose to request deletion of these documents from the Collection.</p></li>

	    <li><p>The limitation on permitted use contained in the following section is intended to reduce the risk of any action being brought by 
	    copyright owners, but if this happens I agree to bear all associated liability.</p></li>

	    <h4><u><b>Permitted Uses</b></u></h4>
	    <li><p>The Collection may only be used for research and development of natural-language processing, information-retrieval or document-understanding systems.</p></li>

	    <li><p>Summaries, analyses and interpretations of the linguistic properties of the Collection may be derived and published, 
	    provided it is not possible to reconstruct the Collection from these summaries.</p></li>

	    <li><p>Small excerpts of the Collection may be displayed to others or published in a scientific or technical context, 
	    solely for the purpose of describing the research and development carried out and related issues.</p></li>

	    <li><p>All efforts must be made not to infringe the rights of any third party including, but not limited to, 
	    the authors and publishers of any excerpts used in accordance with clause 3 above in this “Permitted Uses” section.</p></li>

	    <li><p>I must make sure that I only display the Collection to or share the Collection with persons who also signed this Agreement with NLP Centre.</p></li>

	    <h4><u><b>Agreement to Delete Data on Request</b></u></h4>
