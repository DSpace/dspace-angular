# dspace-angular
> The next UI for DSpace, based on Angular 2 Universal.

This project is currently in pre-alpha.

You can find additional information on the [wiki](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+7+-+Angular+2+UI) or [the project board (waffle.io)](https://waffle.io/DSpace/dspace-angular).

If you're looking for the 2016 Angular 2 DSpace UI prototype, you can find it [here](https://github.com/DSpace-Labs/angular2-ui-prototype)

## Quick start
**Make sure you have Node version >= 5.0 and NPM >= 3**

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/DSpace/dspace-angular.git

# change directory to our repo
cd dspace-angular

# install the global dependencies
npm run global

# install the local dependencies
npm install

# start the server
npm start
```
Then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Introduction to the technology
You can find more information on the technologies used in this project (Angular 2, Typescript, Angular Universal, RxJS, etc) on the [DuraSpace wiki](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+7+UI+Technology+Stack)

## Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* Ensure you're running node >= `v5.x` and npm >= `v3.x`

If you have [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) or [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) installed, which is highly recommended, you can run `nvm install --lts && nvm use` to install and start using the latest Node LTS.

## Installing
* `npm run global` to install the required global dependencies
* `npm install` to install the local dependencies


## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run watch:dev` to start a local server which will watch for changes, rebuild the code, and reload the server for you. You can visit it at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running in production mode
When building for production we're using Ahead of Time (AoT) compilation. With AoT, the browser downloads a pre-compiled version of the application, so it can render the application immediately, without waiting to compile the app first. The compiler is roughly half the size of Angular itself, so omitting it dramatically reduces the application payload.

To build the app for production and start the server run: 	
```bash
npm start
```
If you only want to build for production, without starting, run:
```bash
npm run build:prod:ngc:json
```
This will build the application and put the result in the `dist` folder

## Cleaning
```bash
# clean everything, including node_modules. You'll need to run npm install again afterwards.
npm run clean

# clean files generated by the production build (.ngfactory files, css files, etc)
npm run clean:prod

# cleans the distribution directory
npm run clean:dist
```

## Testing
### Unit Test
Unit tests use Karma. You can find the configuration file at the same level of this README file:
`./karma.conf.js`
If you are going to use a remote test enviroment you need to edit the './karma.conf.js'. Follow the instructions you will find inside it.
To executing tests whenever any file changes you can modify the 'autoWatch' option to 'true' and 'singleRun' option to 'false'.
A coverage report is also available at:
http://localhost:9876/
after you run:
`npm run coverage`.

To correctly run the tests you need to run the build once with:
`npm run build`.

The default browser is Google Chrome.

Place your tests in the same location of the application source code files that they test.

and run:
`npm run test`

### E2E test
E2E tests use Protractor + Selenium server + browsers. You can find the configuration file at the same level of this README file:
`./protractor.conf.js`
Protractor is installed as 'local' as a dev dependency.
If you are going to execute tests locally you need to run (once time only):
`npm run webdriver:update`.

If you are going to use a remote test enviroment you need to edit the './protractor.conf.js'. Follow the instructions you will find inside it.

The default browser is Google Chrome.

Protractor needs a functional instance of the DSpace interface to run the E2E tests, so you need to run:
`npm run watch:dev`

or any command that bring up the DSpace interface.

Place your tests at the following path:
`./e2e`

and run:
`npm run e2e`

## Other commands
There are many more commands in the `scripts` section of `package.json`. Most of these are executed by one of the commands mentioned above.
A command with a name that starts with `pre` or `post` will be executed automatically before or after the script with the matching name. e.g. if you type `npm run start` the `prestart` script will run first, then the `start` script will trigger.


## Recommended Editors/IDEs
To get the most out of TypeScript, you'll need a TypeScript-aware editor. We've had good experiences using these editors:

* Free
  * [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    * [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome)
  * [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    * [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* Paid
  * [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/) or [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
  * [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
    * [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)

## 3rd Party Library Installation

Install your library via `npm install lib-name --save` and import it in your code. `--save` will add it to `package.json`.

If the library does not include typings, you can install them using npm:

```bash
npm install d3 --save
npm install @types/d3 --save-dev
```

If the library doesn't have typings available at `@types/`, you can still use it by
manually adding typings for it:

1. In `src/typings.d.ts`, add the following code:

  ```typescript
  declare module 'typeless-package';
  ```

2. Then, in the component or file that uses the library, add the following code:

  ```typescript
  import * as typelessPackage from 'typeless-package';
  typelessPackage.method();
  ```

Done. Note: you might need or find useful to define more typings for the library that you're trying to use.


If you're importing a module that uses CommonJS you need to import as

```typescript
import * as _ from 'lodash';
```

## Frequently asked questions
* Why is my service, aka provider, is not injecting a parameter correctly?
  * Please use `@Injectable()` for your service for typescript to correctly attach the metadata
* Where do I write my tests?
  * You can write your tests next to your component files. e.g. for `src/app/home/home.component.ts` call it `src/app/home/home.component.spec.ts`
* How do I start the app when I get `EACCES` and `EADDRINUSE` errors?
  * The `EADDRINUSE` error means the port `3000` is currently being used and `EACCES` is lack of permission to build files to `./dist/`
* What are the naming conventions for Angular 2?
 * See [the official angular 2 style guide](https://angular.io/styleguide)
* Why is the size of my app larger in development?
 * The production build uses a whole host of techniques (ahead-of-time compilation, rollup to remove unreachable code, minification, etc.) to reduce the size, that aren't used during development in the intrest of build speed.
* node-pre-gyp ERR in npm install (Windows)
 * install Python x86 version between 2.5 and 3.0 on windows. See [this issue](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/626)
